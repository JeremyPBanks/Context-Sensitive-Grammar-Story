1/1/2018: Finished up the main OOP design, as the global Queue is now fully implemented. Also added functionality for article selection between 'a' and 'an', only using the latter when the selected word begins with a vowel. Currently there is a bug that sometimes generates an infinite loop inside getAdjective(); database selection issue? Will investigate further tomorrow.

1/2/2018: Fixed the getAdjective() issue almost immediately; I was checking for vowels with "strAdj[:0]" instead of "strAdj[0]", so I was accidently checking with nothing instead of the first character in the string. The main work done today was the overhaul of the recursive contextual states, which I did by sketching out a Finite State Automaton beforehand. Following this not only made the code much cleaner and easier to follow, but also improved its overall functionality. We are close to being done the main portion of the back-end now, but there are still some bugs to work out. Currently, the main issues are dealing with plural cases (easy, just haven't implemented it yet) and the contextual placement of nouns with different types of verbs and conjunctions (MUCH trickier). It seems like all this will be is a series of conditionals, as the actual states themselves seem to be valid to maintain the story's grammatical nature. I will look into this further tomorrow, but I am very happy with what I finished up today.
