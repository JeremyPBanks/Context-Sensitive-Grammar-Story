1/1/2018: Finished up the main OOP design, as the global Queue is now fully implemented. Also added functionality for article selection between 'a' and 'an', only using the latter when the selected word begins with a vowel. Currently there is a bug that sometimes generates an infinite loop inside getAdjective(); database selection issue? Will investigate further tomorrow.

1/2/2018: Fixed the getAdjective() issue almost immediately; I was checking for vowels with "strAdj[:0]" instead of "strAdj[0]", so I was accidently checking with nothing instead of the first character in the string. The main work done today was the overhaul of the recursive contextual states, which I did by sketching out a Finite State Automaton beforehand. Following this not only made the code much cleaner and easier to follow, but also improved its overall functionality. We are close to being done the main portion of the back-end now, but there are still some bugs to work out. Currently, the main issues are dealing with plural cases (easy, just haven't implemented it yet) and the contextual placement of nouns with different types of verbs and conjunctions (MUCH trickier). It seems like all this will be is a series of conditionals, as the actual states themselves seem to be valid to maintain the story's grammatical nature. I will look into this further tomorrow, but I am very happy with what I finished up today.

1/4/2018: Ironed out the logic errors regarding plural cases as well as conjunctions/prepositions, requiring more specifications to be placed inside the Prepositions table, but those elements of the story generation seem to be working properly now. For the better part of 1-2 hours, I thought I hit the biggest bug of all when I started getting constant infinite loops along with the occasional crash, but thankfully this was due to a very simple oversight in the getNoun() function (forgot to place additional return statements), which was altered in the process of having to implement the different incarnations of prepositions and Proper Nouns. Next (and biggest thing in the back-end) is to finally tackle the intracacies of different verbs given its context of the sentence. In many ways, the implementation of this is the main point of the project in the first place, so accounting for this is vital. Hopefully I'll be able to crack the code tomorrow.

1/5/2018: Didn't have as much time as I would have liked to work on the project today, but I do believe that I did "crack" the code with respect to how I should implement the grammatical nature of verbs correctly. My plan is to re-route the progression to certain prepositional states based off of the kind of verb it entails. For instance, this should solve the issue of getting returned back incorrect statements such as "Jeremy participated" or "Jeremy protected" into "Jeremy participated in a game" or "Jeremy protected a girl" (in this case, a verb like 'protected' is special and directly re-routes to an article instead of a preposition). All I was able to finish today was the raw database incorporation, and hopefully I'll be able to get this last big segment of the back-end done; next up would be the expansion of the story into multiple sentences and carrying over characters, but completing the grammatical nature correctly takes precedence.
